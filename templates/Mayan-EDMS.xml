  <Overview>DESCRIPTION&#xD;
Mayan EDMS, often simply "Mayan", is an electronic document management system with an emphasis on automation.&#xD;
&#xD;
As a document manager its main purpose is to store, introspect, and categorize files, with a strong emphasis on preserving the contextual and business information of documents. It also provide means to ease retrieval, as requested by users or other software applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large enterprise applications with many concurrent users. It can also OCR, preview, label, sign, send, and receive documents. Other features of interest are its workflow system, role based access control, and REST API.&#xD;
&#xD;
NOTES&#xD;
&#x2022; The program has a built-in SQLite DB (embedded), but if you're going to use it for production it's highly recommended to connect it to an external DB, such as: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL (and others). By default, if no database is configured to connect to the Mayan EDMS instance, it will use the integrated one.&#xD;
&#x2022; The default credentials are auto-generated when the container gets built. Just open WebUI and you will see them up.&#xD;
