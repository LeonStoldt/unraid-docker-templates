  <Overview>DESCRIPTION&#xD;
Euterpe is a self-hosted streaming service for music. Formerly known as "HTTPMS (HTTP Media Server)".&#xD;
&#xD;
A way to listen to your music library from everywhere. Once set up you won't need anything but a browser. Think of it as your own Spotify service over which you have full control. Euterpe will let you browse through and listen to your music over HTTP(s). Up until now I've had a really bad time listening to my music which is stored back home. I would create a mount over ftp, sshfs or something similar and point the local player to the mounted library. Every time it resulted in some upleasantries. Just imagine searching in a network mounted directory!&#xD;

NOTES&#xD;
&#x2022; Check out the different clients that you can use with Euterpe: 'https://listen-to-euterpe.eu/clients'.&#xD;
&#x2022; You can also use a 'config.json' file to manage its configuration, if decided. Check the 'Configuration' section from the documentation to know more.&#xD;
&#x2022; Currently, I'm facing some problems when trying to mount the '/root/.euterpe' container dir, and that's why I didn't add the path to the template. You can follow the issue on GitHub: 'https://github.com/ironsmile/euterpe/issues/42'.&#xD;
